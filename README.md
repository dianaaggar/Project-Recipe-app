# Project3: A MERN Stack Application 

Create a Recipe App using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack is a great way to learn and showcase full-stack development skills. This project involves building a web application that allows users to create, edit and delete recipes. Here's a step by step guide on how to approach this project.

Building a Recipe App using the MERN stack is a comprehensive project that covers various aspects of full-stack web development. it provides valuable experience in working with databases, backend APIs, and frontend UI components while allowing to create a useful and engaging application.

## 1-Project Setup:
Set up the development environment with Node.js and npm installed.
Initialize a new project folder and set up.

## 2-Backend Development (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB):
#### a. Database Setup: 
Install MongoDB and set up a database to store recipe information.
### b. Server Setup:
Create a new Express.js server that listens for incoming requests.
Set up routes for handling CRUD operations on recipes
Implement data validation and error handling for routes.
### c. Database Models:
a-Define Mongoose models for recipes, favorite and users.
b-Create Routes folder.
c-Create Controllers folders.

### d.Implement user authentication.

## 3-Frontend Development (React):
inside src create folders components, pages and utilities.

## 4- create file .env:
the file .env stores configuration variables and sensitive information that should not be hard-coded into your application's source code. 

## 5- connect to github and Deploy the app using render.com 

## Technologies Used
HTML | CSS | MongoDB | Express | React | Node.js | Mongoose | Axios | Bcrypt | JSON Webtoken |

npx create-react-app "name of the project"

npm start => Starts the development server.

npm run build => Bundles the app into static files for production.

npm test => Starts the test runner.

npm run eject => Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

npm i express morgan serve-favicon => Install the Modules for the Express Server.

nodemon server => to run server Backend.

npm i react-router-dom => install react router 

npm i dotenv => .env  file a way to access environment variables and secrets.
